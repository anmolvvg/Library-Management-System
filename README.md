**Benefits of the program**

-> The library management system software helps in reducing operational costs. Managing a library manually is labor intensive and an immense amount of paperwork is involved. An automated system reduces the need for manpower and stationery. This leads to lower operational costs.

->The activities of book purchasing, cataloging, indexing, circulation recording and stock checking are done by the software. Such software eliminates the need for repetitive manual work and minimizes the chances of errors.

->The system should allow the school libraries to manage their student base from a central system accessible from anywhere, anytime. It should be possible for management to view the library operations from anywhere. The program should be accessible from libraries, classrooms, computer labs, homes and any place with an internet connection or web access.

->There are different types of library software. The installed system should be supported by the web. A web based library management system is the most ideal as it provides extensive coverage of books, journals, reference resources.

->The library has to do a check of the vendor and his capabilities prior to buying. The provider has to demonstrate the product to the users. The vendor has to install the library management system software on the computers in the library.
